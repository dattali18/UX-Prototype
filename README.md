# UX-Prototype

## Overview

This project is a UX prototype for a course management application. The prototype is designed to be easy to use and navigate, and it provides a variety of features for managing courses and semesters.

This project was inspired by a course in `UX`/`UI` design, in which we had to present a prototype of an original app idea. This is the real-life project built from that prototype

## Technologies Used

* `Swift`: The prototype is written in `Swift`, which is a modern programming language developed by Apple. `Swif`t is known for its speed, performance, and safety.
* `UIKit:` The prototype uses `UIKit`, which is Apple's framework for developing user interfaces for `iOS` applications. `UIKit` provides a variety of controls and views that can be used to create complex and interactive user interfaces.
* `Model-View-Controller (MVC)` : The prototype follows the `Model-View-Controller (MVC)` design pattern. `MVC` is a design pattern that separates the user interface, the data model, and the application logic into three separate components. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

## Features

The prototype includes a variety of features for managing courses and semesters, such as:

* Viewing a list of all courses and semesters.
* Adding, editing, and deleting courses and semesters.
* Viewing a course's details, including its name, description, and semester.
* Assigning students to courses.
* Viewing a student's grades.

## Installation

To install the prototype, simply clone the repository and open the project in Xcode.

## Usage

To install the prototype, simply clone the repository and open the project in `Xcode`. run the application on an `iOS` device. The prototype will open to a list of all courses and semesters. You can tap on a course or semester to view its details.

To add a new course or semester, tap on the `+` button in the top right corner of the screen. To edit or delete a course or semester, swipe left on the course or semester and tap on the `Edit` or `Delete` button.

## Conclusion

This UX prototype is a valuable tool for designing and developing a course management application. The prototype is easy to use and navigate, and it provides a variety of features for managing courses and semesters.
